# WWDC-2017

I created this project for the [Apple WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/)

The full list of projects is [here](https://github.com/wwdc/2017)

## **About this app**</br>
This app tells a story about one guy who decided to become a developer. </br>
My hero needed to solve a few tasks to reach his goal.</br> 
At the end of the game, he was rewarded by an invitation to attend **WWDC**.

Watch the video below to see the app in action:

## **Tech Overview**
The app has 10 screens.</br> 
The user sees only one scene at a time that is changed by new screens using custom transition animation.</br>Everyone can continue this story as there is a router that can reproduce any scene. The screens’ order isn’t dependable.

This app was created using Swift Playground, Sketch and Zeplin.</br>All pictures were found on free stock photos websites.
